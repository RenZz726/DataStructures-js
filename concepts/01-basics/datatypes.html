//         There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. 
// They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the
//  highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:

// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, 
// using the test data included below. The average score for 
// Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, 
// and the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the 
// scoreKoalas variable.

// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner 
// of the competition, and print to the console:

// "Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

// "Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

// "Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.



// TEST DATA: Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.
