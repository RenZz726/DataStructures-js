# Closures â€” short summary

**Definition:** A closure is a function that remembers the lexical environment in which it was created.

**Key uses:**
- Data privacy / private state
- Currying
- Event handlers that capture values

**Pitfalls:**
- Unintended retained memory (be careful with large objects)
- Overuse makes code harder to follow

**Examples:** See `examples/closure-example.js`
